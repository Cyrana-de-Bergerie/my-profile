# 👋 Hello, I'm Manon!

### From Mainframe to the Cloud  
### From ISPF to Eclipse  
### From Endevor to GitHub  

I’m not a nerd, I’m not a techy, I’m not a geek—but I **can** stay up all night coding for a week straight.  

💡 **Welcome to my new GitHub**—I left my previous one as a gift to my 23-year ex-employer (_Gifthub, we say_).  

### 🎭 About Me
- **Fun, witty, passionate** and a **mother of three** 🏡
- **Urban aviculture** (chickens & quails) 🐓
- **Gardening** 🌱
- **Cooking** 🔥  

📫 _Let's connect!_
